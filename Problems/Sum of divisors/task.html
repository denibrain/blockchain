  <p>For a given range from A to B both inclusive, count sum of numbers that are only divisible by N or M. Use streams to solve the problem.</p> 
  <p>&nbsp;</p> 
  <p>For example, for range from 10 to 20 and N = 2, M = 3, there are 6 numbers that are divisible by N or M: 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18, 20. The sum of these numbers equals 105.</p> 
  <p><br> The input contains a single line with four numbers: A, B, N, M.</p>
